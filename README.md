# Sha Razeek — Mid-Century Jet Age Website

A personal website and digital portfolio built with a "Mid-Century Jet Age" aesthetic. This project serves as a hub for professional work, editorial experiments, and creative side projects, reflecting a passion for hypermedia, UI/UX, and retro-futuristic design.

## ✦ Design Ethos: Mid-Century Modern

The site's visual language is inspired by the optimistic futurism of the 1950s and 60s—the "Jet Age." This is characterized by:

- **Palette:** A curated selection of Cream, Teal, Coral, Mustard, and Charcoal.
- **Typography:** Geometric sans-serifs (Figtree) paired with technical mono-spaced fonts (IBM Plex Mono).
- **Motifs:** Atomic starbursts, jet-age decorative lines, and subtle "springy" animations.
- **Layout:** A flexible sidebar-driven navigation that prioritizes content clarity and editorial flow.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Astro 6.x](https://astro.build/) (Static Output)
- **Runtime:** Node.js (>=22.12.0)
- **Deployment:** [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) via `@astrojs/cloudflare`
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS with custom properties for tokens
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript
